# HajLib

HajLib is NotNet's Minecraft mod library. It contains some boilerplate that isn't too useful as a library, but is too helpful to have to paste into each project we make.

It is written in Kotlin and uses Fabric (but also targets Quilt compatibility). Most features are designed with the assumption that you are using Kotlin.

## Features

- Wrapper around creating and managing Kotlin coroutines
- A no-bullshit event bus
